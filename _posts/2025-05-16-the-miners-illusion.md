## Mining Is Digital Masturbation: You or the Machine — Who's Really in Charge?

You flip the switch. The rigs roar to life like you just kickstarted an angry industrial beast in your own garage. Fans scream. The air thickens with heat. The electricity meter spins like it’s on coke. Feels like power. Feels like you’re building something.

But pause. **Where are *you* in all this?**

Let’s be real. You’re not mining crypto. The machines are. You’re just the janitor. The babysitter. The guy changing thermal paste at 3AM like it’s some sacred ritual. You're not in control — you're managing entropy. Monitoring chaos. Watching dashboards like they’ll whisper the meaning of life if you squint hard enough.

You think you're chasing freedom. Decentralization. Autonomy. But you’re not free — you’re shackled to uptime. Chained to hash rates and power surges. Your god isn't Bitcoin. It's the algorithm. SHA-256. Ethash. Whatever flavor of logic is currently eating your electricity bill alive.

And let’s talk about that bill. Because it’s not just about the money. If it were, you’d have quit after your third fried PSU and that one card that caught fire. You're not in this for ROI anymore — you’re here for something you can’t even name.

You tell yourself it’s about independence. But how independent are you really when you’re dependent on GPU drops, power grids, pool payouts, firmware updates, and a market that can nuke you in a single tweet?

You’re not part of a revolution. You're part of a loop. A sweaty, buzzing, never-ending loop where meaning leaks out with every mined block.

And here’s the existential twist: the machine doesn’t care. It doesn’t get tired. It doesn’t question. It just mines. You, on the other hand, are *human*. You want reasons. Purpose. Resolution. You want to **feel** something.

But there’s no climax in mining. No satisfaction. Just uptime, temperature logs, and the haunting question at 2:43AM: **"What the hell am I even doing?"**

See, mining used to feel like rebellion. Now it feels like watching yourself rot behind six screens, hoping the network doesn't fork and your rig doesn’t brick during the update.

You're not the miner. You're the middleman. The caretaker. The meatbag who serves the algorithm until the algorithm no longer needs him.

And deep down, that burns.

Because you know this isn’t about crypto. It’s about **control**. The illusion that in this noisy, collapsing, fake-ass world, you can still command *something*.

Even if it’s just 600 mega hashes per second.
